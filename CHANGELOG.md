# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fixed `previous()` skipping RRULE occurrences when an earlier `RDATE` ended
  its aligned search prematurely (#138). Rule occurrences and explicit dates
  are now resolved separately, preserving exclusions, query bounds, and
  distant-query performance. Thanks to @timgit for the report and original fix.
- Bounded the backward search by the latest eligible RDATE so sparse rules do
  not replay older dense periods when an explicit date already wins.
- Preserved the DTSTART calendar in `previous()` search anchors, including
  when UNTIL uses another calendar or time zone, to avoid calendar mismatch
  errors for non-ISO recurrences.

## 2.2.4 (2026-09-05)

- Accelerated UTC `MONTHLY` and `YEARLY` generation by selecting calendar days,
  time slots, and `BYSETPOS` ranks numerically before constructing occurrences.
  Targeted local polyfill benchmarks against v2.2.3 measured 5.37-67.75x gains
  for the selected monthly/yearly shapes; callback generation remains lazy.
- Kept simple UTC generators on their fast paths when `RDATE`/`EXDATE` are
  present, preserving recurrence-set ordering. The selected DAILY and SECONDLY
  exception benchmarks improved by 5.06x and 1.93x respectively.
- Fixed calendar recurrences keeping a shifted wall time after a daylight-saving
  gap when time fields are inherited from `DTSTART` (#136, #137). Later occurrences
  restore the original time, including queries after consecutive gap occurrences
  and half-hour timezone transitions. Thanks to @timgit for the original fix.
- Avoided redundant time conversions in the DST fix and added regression coverage
  for generation, queries, intervals, exceptions, and subsecond precision. All
  1,167 tests pass on both Temporal backends and CI's Node 20, 24, and 26 matrix.

## 2.2.3 (2026-09-03)

- Added conservative numeric rank/select plans for Gregorian `YEARLY` rules
  and exception-aware `RDATE`/`EXDATE` merging across supported COUNT-bound
  plans. Boolean and point queries now avoid replaying or materializing the
  complete recurrence set when the optimized shape is proven safe.
- Reduced Temporal conversion overhead by consuming compatible
  `epochNanoseconds` values directly, constructing selected public Temporal
  outputs without string round-trips when supported, caching converted
  `all()` results, and converting iterator values only once.
- Minified the production ESM and CommonJS bundles, disabling
  `temporal-polyfill`'s development-only per-instance debug strings. On the
  documented Node 25 benchmark, UTC generation is now 1.27-5.26x faster than
  `rrule`, while named-zone generation is 42-107x faster.
- Added deterministic differential fuzzing for optimized query plans,
  expanded regression coverage, and refreshed the query and full-generation
  benchmark tables. The public API and recurrence semantics are unchanged.

## 2.2.0 (2026-08-10)

- Added the optional `temporal` rule option for selecting the Temporal
  implementation used by public output values. TypeScript infers that
  implementation's exact `ZonedDateTime` return type, including the matching
  `PlainDate` type returned by `toPlainDate()`.
- Applied the selected implementation consistently to `all()`, `between()`,
  `next()`, `previous()`, iterator callbacks, resolved `options()`, and rules
  created with `with()`. The default native-or-bundled implementation and
  implementation-neutral `temporal-spec` types remain unchanged when the
  option is omitted.

## 2.1.0 (2026-08-10)

- Added lazily cached numeric query plans for proven COUNT-bound `SECONDLY`,
  `MINUTELY`, `HOURLY`, `DAILY`, `WEEKLY`, and Gregorian `MONTHLY` shapes.
  `next()`, `previous()`, narrow `between()`, and `matches()` now rank/select
  epoch or wall-clock values and materialize only returned Temporal objects
  instead of replaying every occurrence from `DTSTART`.
- Preserved exact nanosecond query bounds, inclusive `UNTIL`, recurrence-period
  `maxIterations`, DST-fold instant ordering, and the RFC recurrence-set stream.
  Rules with `RDATE`/`EXDATE`, gap-sensitive wall times, sub-millisecond
  occurrences, `includeDtstart`, RSCALE/non-ISO calendars, or unsupported
  BYxxx combinations automatically use the existing engine.
- Aligned interval-based weekly queries with the recurrence phase returned by
  `all()` and `between()` when the first BYDAY in DTSTART's week has already
  passed.
- Corrected UTC monthly generation for years 0000 through 0099 by replacing
  `Date.UTC`'s 1900 offset behavior with proleptic Gregorian integer math.
- Added differential query tests and a dedicated first-call/warm benchmark.
  On a MacBook Pro M2 Max with Node 25, warmed distant COUNT queries improved
  from 48-806 ms to 9-13 microseconds for fixed-step/simple daily/weekly
  selection, and a narrow expanded daily `between()` improved from 30.4 ms to
  34.7 microseconds. A 9,000-count monthly last-weekday query improved from
  186.3 ms to 31.9 microseconds, while both COUNT-128 cases also became faster.

## 2.0.3 (2026-08-06)

- Corrected RFC 5545 recurrence-set ordering so `COUNT` and `UNTIL` bound
  RRULE-generated occurrences before `RDATE` values are added and `EXDATE`
  values are removed.
- Preserved lazy iterator behavior for recurrence sets with `RDATE` or
  `EXDATE`, keeping `next()` and `previous()` from materializing the complete
  bounded rule before returning.

## 2.0.2 (2026-07-25)

- Added epoch-integer fast paths for simple `SECONDLY` rules and for
  `BYHOUR`/`BYMINUTE`/`BYSECOND` expansion in `DAILY` and `WEEKLY` rules.
  Named-zone paths retain the existing DST-gap fallback to the general
  Temporal engine.
- Expanded differential fast-path coverage and corrected the profiling
  harness to measure uncached recurrence generation.
- Focused before/after median generation times on a MacBook Pro M2 Max with
  Node 25 improved by 34.2% for 3,600 UTC `SECONDLY` occurrences; 64.6% in UTC
  and 62.2% in `America/Chicago` for 1,000 `DAILY` time-slot occurrences; and
  71.9% in UTC and 72.2% in `America/Chicago` for 1,000 `WEEKLY` day/time-slot
  occurrences. The named-zone `SECONDLY` case remained effectively flat
  (+0.3%).

## 2.0.1 (2026-07-21)

- Removed the `engines.node >=20` declaration. It reflected the oldest Node
  version in the project's CI matrix, not a runtime requirement of the
  published package, and unnecessarily warned consumers using older Node
  versions.

## 2.0.0 (2026-07-02)

The recurrence engine was rebuilt around integer epoch math and a pluggable
Temporal implementation. Time-zone-aware rules run **25–60× faster** than
1.6.0 (e.g. "monthly last weekday over 20 years" in `America/Chicago` went
from ~29 ms to ~0.9 ms per `all()` on the polyfill backend and ~0.45 ms on
native Temporal), `next()`/`previous()` no longer scan the whole rule
history, and repeated `all()` calls are served from a cache. Behavior is
locked in by ~80 new tests, including differential fast-path-vs-general
checks across DST transitions in six time zones, and the full suite passes
on both the polyfill and native Temporal backends.

### Breaking changes

- **Returned Temporal objects come from a different implementation.**
  1.x returned `@js-temporal/polyfill` instances. 2.0 returns instances from
  the runtime's **native `Temporal`** when it exists (Node 26+, Chrome 144+,
  Firefox 139+) and otherwise from a bundled **`temporal-polyfill`**. The
  TypeScript surface is unchanged (`temporal-spec` structural types), but:
  - `instanceof` checks against `@js-temporal/polyfill` classes now fail.
  - Passing returned objects into a *different* implementation's methods
    (e.g. `theirZdt.equals(occurrence)`) can throw errors such as
    `TypeError: Missing timeZone`. Re-hydrate instead:

    ```ts
    import { Temporal as AppTemporal } from "@js-temporal/polyfill"; // or any implementation
    const converted = rule.all().map((zdt) => AppTemporal.ZonedDateTime.from(zdt.toString()));
    // or, preserving nanosecond precision:
    // AppTemporal.ZonedDateTime.fromEpochNanoseconds(zdt.epochNanoseconds)
    ```
  Inputs were and remain accepted from any implementation — `dtstart`,
  `until`, `rDate`, `exDate`, and date filters are normalized internally.
- **`@js-temporal/polyfill` is no longer a dependency.** The polyfill
  fallback (`temporal-polyfill/full`) is bundled into the published files,
  so `rrule-temporal` has no runtime Temporal dependency to install. If your
  code imported `@js-temporal/polyfill` transitively through this package,
  add it to your own dependencies.
- **`all()` memoizes results per rule instance.** Callers receive a fresh
  array each call, but the `ZonedDateTime` instances inside are shared
  across calls, and bounded rules keep their occurrence list alive for the
  lifetime of the rule object. Opt out per rule with `cache: false`.
- **`next()`/`previous()` start near the query point** (for rules without
  `COUNT`) instead of iterating from `DTSTART`. Far-future queries that
  previously exhausted `maxIterations` and threw now return the correct
  occurrence; the iteration cap still protects rules that can never match.
- **Parse-error message text changed.** Invalid values are still rejected
  (same call sites, still `throw`), but the message strings come from the
  active Temporal implementation and are not a stable API.
- **`engines` now declares Node >= 20**, matching what CI tests (20, 24, 26).

### Added

- `cache?: boolean` rule option (default `true`) controlling `all()`
  memoization.
- Native Temporal support: on runtimes that ship `Temporal`, the library
  uses it automatically — no polyfill code runs and occurrence
  materialization is several times faster.
- Epoch-integer fast paths for **every** time zone (previously UTC-only):
  daily, hourly/minutely fixed-step, weekly, and monthly BYDAY/BYMONTHDAY
  rules iterate wall-clock time as integers and resolve instants through a
  cached per-zone offset-transition table with RFC 5545 `compatible`
  gap/fold semantics. Rules whose time of day can fall inside a DST gap
  automatically use the general engine so gap behavior is unchanged.

### Changed

- RFC 7529 `RSCALE` non-Gregorian rules (Chinese, Hebrew, Indian) always
  compute calendar math with the bundled polyfill, even when native Temporal
  is active: implementations disagree on non-ISO calendar details (V8
  numbers Chinese calendar years in a continuous era, and its Hebrew date
  arithmetic is incomplete), and recurrence results must not change with the
  runtime.
- `toText()` formats times and dates via `Intl.DateTimeFormat` directly, so
  output is identical across Temporal implementations.
- `EXDATE` exclusion uses a set of epoch values; `RDATE` merging skips
  re-sorting already-chronological results.
- Benchmarks in `benchmarks/` now measure cached and uncached modes for all
  three libraries; both README tables were refreshed.
